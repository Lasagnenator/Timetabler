# Timetabler

Follow instructions presented by XMLGenerator to generate the timetable.

Then build the app to your phone (or use the apk from the Releases tab) and install that.

Then copy the xml file from XMLGenerator/bin/Debug/Saves/Timetable.xml to your phone.

Copy the xml file to /Android/data/com.timetable.timetable/files/ (may have to run the app once to generate folder)

Launch app. Should just work.
